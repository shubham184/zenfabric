## Hey, I'm Shubham

I'm a Data Engineer specializing in **Microsoft Fabric**, **Power BI**, and modern data architecture.

### What I Do

By day, I help organizations build scalable data platforms. By night (and weekends), I write about what I learn — the wins, the failures, and everything in between.

### Why ZenFabric?

**Zen** = Clarity, simplicity, focus
**Fabric** = Microsoft Fabric, and the interconnected nature of modern data

This blog exists because I was tired of reading documentation that assumes you already know everything, and tutorials that only work in perfect conditions.

Here, you'll find:

- **Practical tutorials** that work in the real world
- **Architecture guides** that explain the "why" not just the "how"
- **Cost optimization tips** that actually save money
- **Honest field notes** including my mistakes
